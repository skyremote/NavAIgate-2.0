# NavAIgate 2.0

## What This Is

A complete rebuild of navaigate.dev with the visual identity and interaction design of bluplai.com. NavAIgate is Daniel's AI consultancy focused on custom tools, consulting, and client partnerships. The site will showcase existing clients (Autodesk, etc.), feature Daniel as the sole face of the company, and launch **Ente-prise** — an enterprise AI chatbot that helps organizations navigate from where they are with AI to where they need to be.

## Core Value

Get 500 qualified signups for Ente-prise while establishing NavAIgate as a credible, professional AI consultancy.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Complete visual redesign matching bluplai aesthetic (animations, layout, typography, colors)
- [ ] Daniel's profile and imagery featured throughout (not Leandro)
- [ ] Client showcase section (Autodesk and other existing clients)
- [ ] Ente-prise waiting list with 500-person cap
- [ ] Full early access flow: collect details, qualify leads, schedule demos
- [ ] Partnership mention with bluplai
- [ ] Contact functionality (email form + WhatsApp integration)
- [ ] Migrate existing custom apps from current NavAIgate site
- [ ] Built with Astro framework
- [ ] Deploy to navaigate.dev (existing domain)

### Out of Scope

- Pricing page — all pricing through direct conversations
- Team page / multiple team members — Daniel only, no Leandro
- Public EDGE branding — product is called Ente-prise (like Ente the Duck)

## Context

**Ente-prise Product Vision:**
An enterprise AI chatbot that navigates decisions rather than just generating text. Named after Ente (German for duck), representing migration — helping organizations migrate from ineffective AI usage to structured, framework-driven AI adoption.

Key capabilities (from Autodesk presentation):
- Tuned around CTV, Technical Proposals, Account workflows, Consumption patterns
- Works like an "engineered Python script" — follows rules, frameworks, GTM processes
- Reduces prep time 25-40% and admin time 20-30%
- Captures decisions, creates consistency, enables reusable workflows
- Target: save users 2-3 hours per week immediately

**Reference Codebases:**
- Current NavAIgate: `/Users/Sky/Documents/GitHub/Navaigate`
- Design reference (bluplai): `/Users/Sky/Documents/GitHub/bluplai`

**Brand Context:**
- Daniel is founder of NavAIgate and works with bluplai
- NavAIgate focuses on custom AI tools and consulting
- Partnership with bluplai should be highlighted

## Constraints

- **Framework**: Astro — non-negotiable
- **Domain**: navaigate.dev — existing domain must be preserved
- **Integrations**: Email and WhatsApp contact methods must work
- **Apps**: Existing custom apps must be migrated from current site
- **Design Source**: Visual patterns from bluplai.com to be adapted

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use Astro framework | Consistency with bluplai, SSG performance | — Pending |
| 500-person cap on Ente-prise waitlist | Create exclusivity and urgency | — Pending |
| Full early access qualification flow | Quality over quantity for enterprise leads | — Pending |
| Daniel-only branding | Clear founder-led consultancy positioning | — Pending |
