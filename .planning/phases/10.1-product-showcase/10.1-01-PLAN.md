    - Display all 3 logos in a horizontal row with flex layout
    - Each logo should be:
      - Large and prominent (h-12 to h-16 on desktop, h-10 on mobile)
      - Wrapped in an anchor tag linking to respective product
      - Have hover effects (scale, opacity, or glow)
      - Open in new tab (target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer")
    - Use responsive sizing (smaller on mobile, larger on desktop)
    - Add subtle separator or spacing from CTA buttons above

    Note: URL-encode "Still Me.png" as "Still%20Me.png" for the image src.

         - Large logo (centered, ~h-20 to h-24)
         - Product name as heading
         - Brief description (1-2 lines)
         - "Visit" or "Learn More" button/link
       - Cards should have glass/gradient styling matching site aesthetic
       - Hover effects on cards (lift, glow, border highlight)

    2. Export from index.ts

    3. Add to index.astro between ClientsSection and EntepriseSection (or after EntepriseSection before Contact)

    Product descriptions:
    - Bluplai: "AI-powered platform for intelligent automation"
