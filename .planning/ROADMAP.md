# Roadmap: NavAIgate 2.0

## Overview

Complete rebuild of navaigate.dev with bluplai's visual identity and interaction design. The journey takes us from Astro foundation through design system implementation, content sections, Ente-prise waitlist with lead qualification, contact integrations, existing app migration, and final deployment — delivering a professional AI consultancy site that captures 500 qualified enterprise leads.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Set up Astro project with proper structure, extract design tokens from bluplai reference
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Unlikely (standard Astro setup, existing bluplai codebase available)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 2: Design System
**Goal**: Build component library matching bluplai's animations, typography, colors, and layout patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (adapting from existing bluplai codebase)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 3: Hero & Navigation
**Goal**: Implement main landing hero section and responsive navigation
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns from design system)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: About/Daniel Section
**Goal**: Create Daniel's founder profile section with imagery and story
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Unlikely (content and layout work using design system)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 5: Client Showcase
**Goal**: Build client display section featuring Autodesk and other existing clients
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Research**: Unlikely (standard section using design system)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 6: Ente-prise Product
**Goal**: Create Ente-prise product section with value proposition, capabilities, and enterprise positioning
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Research**: Unlikely (content presentation using design system)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 7: Waitlist System
**Goal**: Implement 500-person capped waitlist with early access flow and lead qualification
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Research**: Likely (backend decision needed)
**Research topics**: Waitlist implementation options (Supabase vs Airtable vs custom), lead qualification flow patterns, 500-cap enforcement strategy
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 8: Contact Integration
**Goal**: Implement email contact form and WhatsApp integration
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Research**: Likely (external API integrations)
**Research topics**: WhatsApp Business API or click-to-chat options, email service provider (Resend, SendGrid, etc.), form handling patterns
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 9: Custom Apps Migration
**Goal**: Migrate existing custom apps from current NavAIgate site
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Research**: Likely (existing codebase analysis)
**Research topics**: Current apps inventory and structure in `/Users/Sky/Documents/GitHub/Navaigate`, migration requirements, integration approach with new Astro site
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 10: Polish & Deploy
**Goal**: Final animations, SEO optimization, and deployment to navaigate.dev
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Research**: Unlikely (standard deployment patterns)
**Plans**: TBD
